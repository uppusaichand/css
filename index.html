    <p>Virat Kohli: A dominating performance, something that we were striving to do again. Now it will be interesting to see what happens on 7th (November).</p>
    <p>T20 is a crazy format. Momentum is the key, as they say. And when that combines with the little luck that you need, sky is the limit. Not so long ago, this Indian team was the verge of a premature exit with two bad losses. They could still be knocked out if the Kiwis win their next game, but the manner in which they have bounced back is exemplary to say the least. Two monstrous wins and the net run-rate is almost not a factor anymore. Momentum box has been ticked for sure. Now about the luck part, let's see if they get lucky with NZ losing. Mind you, Afghanistan can also cause a stir if they win really big and India don't manage to do the same against Namibia. But that's what luck is about, isn't it? These situations are too tricky to predict. If you're an Indian supporter, you should be proud that the team is still in there and fighting it out in style. Today's game was indeed the perfect Diwali gift for all Indians. As a contest, it was one-sided though. Let's hope we get more competitive games tomorrow. On that note, this is Hari Sadanandan signing off on behalf of MS Ramakrishnan, Sagar Chawla, Abhinand Raghavendran and Siva. Cheers!</p>
